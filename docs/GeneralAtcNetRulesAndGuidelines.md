# General Rules and Guidelines for ATC-Net organisation

*- minutes of the meeting 22-01-2021 extended with some already existing ATC-team work*


## Introduction

The ATC-Net organisation has a list of [repositories](https://github.com/atc-net).
All these repositories are split up and managed by people from the core tema, referred to as `ATC-team`.

* All repositories are free for use and possible to contribute to - ATC-Net use `MIT license`.

* Each repository is managed by one or more people from the ATC-team, referred to as `Repo-Admin` (GitHub Role is Admin).

* Everyone can contribute to a repository by making a pull-request, referred to as `PR`.

The process for creating a new repository, must go through the ATC-team. In this process there are important steps that have to be defined, like repository naming, purpose and who should be Repo-Admins. The repository setup should follow a ATC repository template with some settings.
This process and repository template is under 'construction', but for now som parts can be found under [snippets for atc-github-setup](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/tree/main/atc-github-setup).


## What does it mean to be a Repo-Admin

The meaning of a Repo-Admin, is just that the person(s) takes responsibility for driving the repository and ensuring the common ATC-Rules, settings and git-workflows are in a acceptable form / in sync with the ATC-team `knowledge and attitudes`.

A few basic rules are:
* Ensure a process is enabled, like `PR`
* Ensure `beta` Nuget-packages is stored in [GitHub Packages-Repository](https://github.com/orgs/atc-net/packages)
* Ensure `release` Nuget-packages is stored in [Nuget.org Packages-Repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=atc-net)
