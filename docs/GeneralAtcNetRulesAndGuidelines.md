*- minutes of the meeting 22-01-2021 extended with some already existing ATC-team work*


## Introduction

ATC-Net organisation have a list of [repositories](https://github.com/atc-net).
All these repositories are split up and manages by people from the core tema, referred as `ATC-team`.

* All repositories is free for use and contribute to - ATC-Net use `MIT license`.

* Each repository is manage by one or more person from the ATC-team, referred as `Repo-Admin` (GitHub Role is Admin).

* Everyone can contribute to a repository by making a pull-request, referred as `PR`.

The process for creating a new repository, must go through the ATC-team. In the process there are important steps that have to be defined, like repository naming, purpose and who should be Repo-Admins. Then the repository setup should follow a ATC repository template with some settings.
This process is under 'construction', but for now som parts can be found under [snippets for atc-github-setup](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-snippets/tree/main/atc-github-setup).


## What does it mean to be a Repo-Admin

The meaning of a Repo-Admin, is just that the person takes responsibility to drive the repository and ensure the common ATC-Rules, settings and git-workflows are in a acceptable form / in sync with the ATC-team `knowledge and attitudes`.

Few basic rules is:
* Ensure a process enable, like `PR`
* Ensure `beta` Nuget-packages is stored in [GitHub Packages-Repository](https://github.com/orgs/atc-net/packages)
* Ensure `release` Nuget-packages is stored in [Nuget.org Packages-Repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=atc-net)
